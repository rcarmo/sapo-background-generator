# SAPO Background Generator

A tool to generate images from SVGs rendered by the [Trianglify](https://github.com/qrohlf/trianglify) JS plugin, modified to use the SAPO brand colors. Originally developed by [Alessandro](alssndro/trianglify-background-generator).

See the app in action [here](http://rcarmo.github.io/sapo-background-generator/).

## Issues

* Palettes are hardcoded
* Strokes are invisible (for now)
